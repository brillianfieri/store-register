## About

The store register is a simple tool for sellers to manage their inventory and record sales transactions. It also includes a dashboard for gaining insights into their sales performance.

There are three main pages for this project:

- ** Dashboard:  ** This page displays charts for the total transactions in the current month, total sales by items, and total sales by category. Additionally, it features a chart comparing gross sales for the last three years.
- ** Transaction:  ** On this page, the seller can select items from the inventory to add to the cart and proceed with checkout. They can also view a list of all transactions and delete them.
- ** Inventory:  ** This page allows the seller to add, edit, and delete items in the inventory.


This project uses:

- Next.js framework
- Prisma as the database connector
- PostgreSQL as the database system
- Tailwind as the CSS framework
- Snippets of code from Flowbites, Stackoverflow, and tutorialspoint websites
